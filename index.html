<h2>A funny story</h2>
<p>One evening last year I boiled some water and started to cook some spaghetti, when my neighbour asked me for help with her internet router. It ended up taking longer than expected and I completely forgot about the food. When I came back home I went upstairs to my room, but after about an hour, I started to smell some burning. I rushed downstairs to find the cooking pot on fire. I put on some oven gloves and picked up the pan end put it outside with the lid on to put out the flames. And I lived happily ever after.</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>I once almost burned my house down while cooking spaghetti.</p>
